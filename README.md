# EasyRate Android
[![](https://jitpack.io/v/grezzled/EasyRate.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#grezzled/EasyRate)

EasyRate is an Android library for dealing with app ratings & feedbacks.
In simple words, it shows a modern and well-designed dialog to engage users to rate the app in Google Play. To avoid bad ratings, the CTA Button changes according to the user's review as Follow : 
- Write Feedback: if review between 1 & 3 Stars
- Rate: if a review is 4 or 5 Stars

## Getting Started
Add to your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:
```java
allprojects {
		repositories {
			...
			maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
		}
	}
```
Step 2. Add the dependency

```java
implementation 'com.github.grezzled:EasyRate:1.0.2'
```

## Basic Usage
Show dialog
```java
EasyRate.init(MainActivity.this)
        .setMailingContact("YOUR_EMAIL@email.com","write a subject","write a description")
        .show();
```
Initiate to show dialog at an appropriate timing
```java
EasyRate.init(MainActivity.this)
        .setMailingContact("YOUR_EMAIL@email.com","write a subject","write a description")
        .build();
```


## Advanced Usage
In default, the dialog will be shown when the following conditions is satisfied.
- App is launched more than 3 times
- App is launched more than 3 days later than installation.
```java
        EasyRate.init(MainActivity.this)
                .setMailingContact("YOUR_EMAIL@email.com","write a subject","write a description")
                .setLaunchesDelay(10) // App Launched more than 10 times
                .setDaysDelay(7) // App is launched more than 7 days later than installation.
                .setOnCloseClickListener(new EasyRate.OnCloseClick() {
                    @Override
                    public void onCloseClickListener() {
                        // Set what to do when close button clicked!
                    }
                })
                .setOnFeedbackClickListener(new EasyRate.OnFeedbackClick() {
                    @Override
                    public void onFeedBackClickListener() {
                      /* By Overriding this Listener, Feedback by email will be ignored 
                        * and "setMailingContact()" won't be necessary anymore.
                        * You can call a feedback activity, open a link, your Instagram account or whatever you want
                       */
                    }
                })
                .build();
```
Reset Count of launches and days to 0
```java
EasyRate.resetDelay(context); 
```
Prevent the dialog from showing again
```java
EasyRate.dontShowAgain(true,context);
```
